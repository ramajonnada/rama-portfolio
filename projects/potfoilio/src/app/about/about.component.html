			Hi there! My name is <b>Rama Jonnada</b>, and I'm an ambitious and experienced Full-Stack Developer.
		</p>
		<p>
			I started my coding journey by creating simple games like Minesweeper and 2048. These early projects sparked
			my interest in coding and problem-solving. Over the years, I have gained experience in web development,
			working across both the front-end and back-end, and integrating RESTful APIs to build comprehensive websites
			and applications that not only look great but also function seamlessly across any device.
		</p>
		<p>
			My goal is to learn something new every day, improve my skills, and solve user and business issues. I can
			quickly analyze problems and solve them both independently and in a team. Now, I'm looking for a new
			position and new challenges.
		</p>
